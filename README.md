# rakuten

<p>This is my solution for the Rakuten test.</p>
<p>This app is made without using any boilerplate or thirdparty library. It is used with pure css, React and Webpack as a development server.</p>
<p>Node modules are not included.</p>
<p>To install all dependencies: <b>npm install</b>
<p>To run use: <b>npm start</b></p>

<p>Code lines are commented.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h3>Gotchas:</h3>
<p>-Adding a Loading state spinner and style it instead of "Loading.." plain text.</p>
<p>-Error handling when we can't retrieve the desired information to display the movies because api is not available with hidding the affected component.</p>
<p>-Error handling when we can't connect to the api server with a properly styled message on the screen.</p>
<p>-Integrating with redux in a next version so we can handle better all the states and data.</p>
<p>-Using cypress for testing the whole app.</p>
<p>-Use express as development server and webpack as a middleware.</p>
<p>-Add the Rakuten fav-icon.</p>
<p>-Improve the styling of the arrow boxes so it looks more neat.</p>
