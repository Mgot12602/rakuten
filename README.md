# rakuten

This is my solution for the Rakuten test.
This app is made without using any boilerplate or thirdparty library. It is used with pure css, React and Webpack as a development server.
Node modules are not included.
To install all dependencies: npm install
To run use: npm start

Code lines are commented.
Thank you!
